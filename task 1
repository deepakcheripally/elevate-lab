# Task 1: Scan Local Network for Open Ports

## Tools Used
- Nmap

## Objective
Find open ports on devices in the local network to understand network exposure.

## IP Range Scanned by using cmd [ip a]
`10.0.2.0/24`

## Results
used cmd [sudo nmap -sS 10.0.2.0/24 -oN local_scan.txt] to ferform scan on ip 10.0.2.0/24
- `10.0.2.2`: Ports 135 (msrpc), 445 (microsoft-ds)
- `10.0.2.3`: Port 53 (domain)
- `10.0.2.15`: No open ports

## Conclusion
This scan identified services exposed on the network. Ports 445 and 135 could pose security risks.
