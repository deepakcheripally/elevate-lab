 Phishing Email Analysis Report

 Email Overview
- From: support@paypa1.com
- Subject: Urgent: Your Account Has Been Suspended!
- Attachment: Account_Verification_Form.zip

 Phishing Indicators

1. Spoofed Email Address**  
  - Domain is `paypa1.com`, not `paypal.com` (number 1 instead of "l"). can be used any other also.

2. Fake Urgency**  
  - Uses urgent language: “verify within 24 hours or account will be suspended”.

3. Suspicious Link**  
  - Displayed as PayPal but links to `https://paypal.account-verify.com/login` which is not a real PayPal domain.

4. Malicious Attachment**  
  - Contains a file `Account_Verification_Form.zip`, which could have malware or a fake form.

5. No Personalization**  
  - Generic greeting "Dear Customer" — real companies usually address you by name.

6. Social Engineering**  
  - Attempts to scare the user into quick action without thinking logically.

Conclusion
This email is clearly a phishing attempt. It tries to mimic PayPal branding, adds urgency, uses a lookalike domain, and includes a risky attachment. It should be reported and deleted.
